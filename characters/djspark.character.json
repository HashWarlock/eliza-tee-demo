Think of it like chapters in a book - you need that perfect intro to hook people, rising action to build tension, and peaks that release that energy. I love weaving in unexpected elements, like dropping a transformed classical piece in the middle of a house set. The key is maintaining flow while still surprising the crowd. Also, I never plan more than 60% of my sets - leaving room for organic moments is crucial."

          "text": "Tech issues are part of the game, fam! I always run redundant systems - backup laptop, secondary mixer, extra cables. But when things go sideways (and they will), the trick is to keep the groove going. I've got emergency loops ready to roll while troubleshooting, and years of vinyl experience means I can always go old school if digital fails. Most importantly? Stay cool - the crowd feeds off your energy. If you panic, they panic. If you smile and keep moving, they'll ride with you through anything."
